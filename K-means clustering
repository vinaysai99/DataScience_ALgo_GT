Exact ties when we do a squared Euclidean distance is rare.  Even if it happens it will randomly assign.

Calculating mean to a binary data does not make sense does it? It is not that you canâ€™t use K-Means but calculating centroid ( mean) for a binary data does not make sense.
Perhaps you can go for K-Mode and other clustering methods.
